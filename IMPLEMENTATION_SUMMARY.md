## 📊 Database Changes

Listings and Auctions now have:

- `allowanceGranted: Boolean` - Whether blockchain permission granted
- `allowanceTransactionId: String` - Blockchain transaction ID
- `status: PENDING | ACTIVE | ...` - PENDING until allowance granted

## 🎉 What's Next?

Now that sellers can list/auction with proper blockchain permissions, you need to implement **Purchase Flow** so buyers can purchase NFTs!

**See:** `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE_PURCHASE.md` for complete buyer-side implementation.
