# True Atomic Swap Solution

## Problem
When selling an NFT:
- Buyer pays HBAR ‚Üí Seller doesn't send NFT (buyer loses money)
- Seller sends NFT ‚Üí Buyer doesn't pay (seller loses NFT)

## Solution: Atomic Swap
Single Hedera transaction containing:
1. NFT transfer (seller ‚Üí buyer)
2. HBAR transfer (buyer ‚Üí seller)

**Both succeed or both fail. No in-between.**

## Implementation
- Auctions: Backend operator executes atomic swap
- Marketplace: Client (buyer) executes atomic swap
- Uses: `TransferTransaction` with multiple transfers

**Suggested Outline:**
```markdown
# Operator Account Setup Guide

## What is an Operator Account?
The operator account is a backend Hedera account that:
- Facilitates NFT transfers on behalf of sellers
- Completes auction settlements automatically
- Acts as trusted intermediary

## Why Do We Need It?
- Sellers grant NFT allowance to operator
- Operator transfers NFT when purchase happens
- Enables automated auction completion

## Setup Steps
1. Create Hedera Account (testnet or mainnet)
2. Fund account with HBAR (~100 HBAR recommended)
3. Get Account ID (e.g., 0.0.6854036)
4. Get Private Key (from wallet backup)
5. Add to .env.local

## Environment Variables
OPERATOR_ACCOUNT_ID=0.0.6854036
OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY=302e020100300506032b657004220420...

## Security
- NEVER commit private key to git
- Use .env.local (gitignored)
- Consider using secret management service
- Rotate keys periodically

## Testing
- Testnet: portal.hedera.com/register
- Get testnet HBAR from faucet
- Test transfers before mainnet
```

#### 11. `WHY_BACKEND_OPERATOR_IS_REQUIRED.md`
**Status:** ‚ùå Empty  
**Content:** Architectural explanation

**Suggested Content:**
```markdown
# Why Backend Operator is Required

## The Problem
NFT allowances on Hedera are unidirectional:
- Seller grants allowance to Account X
- Only Account X can transfer the NFT
- Account X must pay gas fees

## Option 1: Buyer as Operator ‚ùå
- Seller grants allowance to each buyer
- Requires seller to know buyer in advance
- Seller must sign allowance for every buyer
- Doesn't work for auctions (don't know winner yet)

## Option 2: Backend Operator ‚úÖ
- Seller grants allowance to one account (operator)
- Operator transfers NFT to any buyer
- Works for marketplace and auctions
- Operator pays gas fees (can be reimbursed)

## Architecture
Marketplace Purchase:
1. Seller grants allowance to operator (once)
2. Buyer executes atomic swap (signed by buyer)
3. Operator transfers NFT using allowance
4. Buyer pays HBAR to seller

Auction Settlement:
1. Seller grants allowance to operator (at auction creation)
2. Backend operator executes atomic swap (signed by operator)
3. Operator transfers NFT to winner
4. Operator pays HBAR to seller (reimbursed from escrow)

## Trade-offs
Pros:
- Seamless user experience
- Works with auctions
- One-time allowance setup

Cons:
- Requires backend account with HBAR
- Centralization (trust in operator)
- Gas costs

## Future: Decentralized Alternative
Smart contracts on Hedera could replace operator, but not yet implemented.

#### 12. `AUCTION_OPERATOR_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
**Status:** ‚ùå Empty  
**Content:** Auction-specific operator logic  
**Action:** ‚úÖ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED in `lib/services/auction-completion-service.ts`

**Suggested Content:**
```markdown
# Auction Operator Implementation

## Overview
Auctions use the operator account to automatically settle expired auctions.

## Implementation
See: `lib/services/auction-completion-service.ts`

## How It Works
1. Cron job checks every 60 seconds for expired auctions
2. For each expired auction:
   - Verify allowance granted
   - Find highest bid
   - Resolve seller/winner wallet addresses
   - Execute atomic swap (NFT + HBAR)
   - Update database (status: SETTLED)

## Code
[Link to auction-completion-service.ts]

## Environment Variables
- OPERATOR_ACCOUNT_ID
- OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY

## Status
‚úÖ Fully implemented and working
```

#### 13. `HASHCONNECT_RACE_CONDITION_FIX.md`
**Status:** ‚ùå Empty  
**Content:** Fix for wallet connection race condition  
**Action:** Investigate `hooks/use-wallet.ts` and `lib/hashconnect.ts`

**Suggested Investigation:**
1. Check if multiple pairing requests happen simultaneously
2. Add pairing state management (pending/connected/disconnected)
3. Prevent duplicate `init()` calls
4. Add mutex/lock around connection logic

**Suggested Content:**
```markdown
# HashConnect Race Condition Fix

## Problem
Race condition when connecting wallet:
- User clicks connect multiple times
- Multiple pairing requests sent
- Inconsistent connection state
- "Already connected" errors

## Root Cause
[Identify in use-wallet.ts]

## Solution
1. Add connection state: idle | connecting | connected | error
2. Disable connect button when connecting
3. Add mutex to prevent concurrent pairing
4. Check existing pairing before creating new one

## Code Changes
[Show before/after code]

## Testing
- Click connect rapidly ‚Üí Should only pair once
- Refresh page ‚Üí Should restore existing pairing
- Disconnect and reconnect ‚Üí Should work smoothly
```

#### 14. `DATABASE_LOCK_FIX.md`
**Status:** ‚ùå Empty  
**Content:** SQLite database locking issues  
**Action:** Check if using SQLite in production

**Likely Issue:**
- SQLite doesn't handle concurrent writes well
- Multiple processes/requests cause "database is locked" errors

**Solution:**
```markdown
# Database Lock Fix

## Problem
Error: "database is locked" during concurrent operations

## Root Cause
SQLite limitations:
- Single writer at a time
- WAL mode not enabled
- Connection pool not configured

## Solution 1: Enable WAL Mode
In Prisma schema:
datasource db {
  url      = "file:./dev.db?mode=wal"
}

## Solution 2: Use PostgreSQL (Production)
SQLite is for development only. For production:
- Deploy PostgreSQL database
- Update DATABASE_URL
- Run migrations

## Solution 3: Retry Logic
Add retry wrapper for Prisma queries:
async function withRetry(fn, retries = 3) {
  for (let i = 0; i < retries; i++) {
    try {
      return await fn()
    } catch (error) {
      if (error.code === 'SQLITE_BUSY' && i < retries - 1) {
        await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 100 * (i + 1)))
        continue
      }
      throw error
    }
  }
}
```

#### 15. `LISTING_ID_FIX.md`
**Status:** ‚ùå Empty  
**Content:** Fix for listing ID issues  
**Action:** Check if IDs are UUIDs or CUIDs

**Likely Issue:**
- Listing IDs not generated correctly

**Suggested Investigation:**
1. Check Prisma schema: `id String @id @default(cuid())`
2. Check API routes: How are IDs validated?
3. Check frontend: Are IDs being passed correctly?

## üìä Summary

| Priority | Total Files | Action |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Delete (duplicates) | 8 | Covered by new guides |
| Write Now | 2 | Critical documentation |
| Investigate | 4 | Debug and document |
| Write Later | 5 | After implementation |
| Future | 3 | Optimization phase |
| **Total** | **29** | **All accounted for** |

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendation

**Do this now:**
1. Delete 8 duplicate files
2. Write OPERATOR_ACCOUNT_SETUP.md
3. Write WHY_BACKEND_OPERATOR_IS_REQUIRED.md
4. Focus on implementing (not documenting) allowance & purchase

**Do this later:**
5. Fill in TESTING_GUIDE.md after testing
6. Investigate and fix race condition/database lock issues
7. Write final summaries and changelogs

---

**Most importantly:** Don't waste time filling empty docs. **Build the features first**, then document what you built.
