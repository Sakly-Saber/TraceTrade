# Buy Now Feature - Setup Complete ‚úÖ

## Overview
The Buy Now feature uses a **2-step purchase flow**:
1. **Frontend**: Buyer sends HBAR payment directly to seller via HashPack wallet
2. **Backend**: Verifies payment on Hedera Mirror Node, then transfers NFT using operator key

## Updated Operator Credentials

**New Valid Operator Account:**
- Account ID: `0.0.6854036`
- Private Key: `0x2ed51bfe9104afd3340c3d26b7a316f008dbd8de0ba2b3e8389e247a5c32218c`

**Environment Variables Updated in `.env`:**
```properties
OPERATOR_ID=0.0.6854036
OPERATOR_KEY=0x2ed51bfe9104afd3340c3d26b7a316f008dbd8de0ba2b3e8389e247a5c32218c
OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY=0x2ed51bfe9104afd3340c3d26b7a316f008dbd8de0ba2b3e8389e247a5c32218c
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPERATOR_ID=0.0.6854036
```

## Files Updated

### 1. API Routes (Backend)
- ‚úÖ `app/api/marketplace/execute-nft-transfer/route.ts` - NFT transfer execution with new operator
- ‚úÖ `app/api/marketplace/purchase/route.ts` - Purchase validation with new operator
- ‚úÖ `.env` - Environment variables with new operator credentials

### 2. Frontend
- ‚úÖ `components/buy-now-modal.tsx` - Already using correct 2-step flow

## How It Works

### Purchase Flow:
```
1. User clicks "Buy Now" on NFT listing
   ‚Üì
2. Frontend validates:
   - HashPack wallet connected
   - Buyer has sufficient HBAR balance
   - Buyer ‚â† Seller
   - Seller has granted allowance to operator (0.0.6854036)
   ‚Üì
3. Buyer approves HBAR payment in HashPack (buyer ‚Üí seller)
   ‚Üì
4. Frontend sends payment transaction ID to backend
   ‚Üì
5. Backend verifies payment on Hedera Mirror Node (with retries)
   ‚Üì
6. Backend transfers NFT using operator key (seller ‚Üí buyer)
   ‚Üì
7. Backend updates database:
   - Listing status ‚Üí SOLD
   - NFT ownership ‚Üí buyer
   - Stores both transaction IDs
   ‚Üì
8. Frontend shows success with both transaction IDs
```

### Mirror Node Verification:
- **Retries**: 5 attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 3s, 5s, 8s)
- **Transaction ID Format**: Converts Hedera SDK format (`0.0.xxx@timestamp.nnn`) to Mirror Node format (`0.0.xxx-sss-nnn`)
- **Verifies**: Transaction exists, succeeded, correct sender/receiver, correct amount
- **Tolerance**: ¬±0.01 HBAR for small transaction fee differences

### Database Updates:
```typescript
// Listing marked as SOLD
MarketplaceListing.status = 'SOLD'
MarketplaceListing.soldAt = new Date()
MarketplaceListing.transactionId = 'paymentTxId,nftTransferTxId'

// NFT ownership transferred
NFTAsset.ownerId = buyerId
```

## Critical Requirements

### ‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE TESTING:

1. **Restart Development Server** (required for API changes):
   ```powershell
   # Press Ctrl+C to stop current server, then:
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Seller MUST Grant Allowance** to operator before listing:
   ```typescript
   // Seller must execute this BEFORE listing NFT:
   const allowanceTx = new AccountAllowanceApproveTransaction()
     .approveTokenNftAllowanceAllSerialsAllowance(
       tokenId,
       sellerAccountId,
       '0.0.6854036'  // NEW operator account
     )
   
   await allowanceTx.execute(client)
   ```

3. **Operator Account Requirements**:
   - ‚úÖ Account exists: 0.0.6854036
   - ‚úÖ Private key available
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Must have sufficient HBAR for transaction fees (~0.05 HBAR)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Seller must grant allowance to this specific account

## Testing Checklist

### Before Testing:
- [ ] Development server restarted
- [ ] Seller has granted allowance to operator 0.0.6854036
- [ ] Operator account has HBAR for fees
- [ ] HashPack wallet installed and connected
- [ ] Test listing exists with status='ACTIVE' and allowanceGranted=true

### During Testing:
- [ ] "Buy Now" button appears for listings with allowance
- [ ] Modal shows NFT details and price
- [ ] HashPack prompts for HBAR payment approval
- [ ] Payment transaction succeeds (check HashScan)
- [ ] Backend verifies payment (check console logs)
- [ ] NFT transfer succeeds (check HashScan)
- [ ] Database updated (listing=SOLD, ownership transferred)
- [ ] Success screen shows both transaction IDs

### After Testing:
- [ ] Verify buyer owns NFT on HashScan
- [ ] Verify seller received HBAR on HashScan
- [ ] Check database: listing status=SOLD, NFT ownerId=buyerId
- [ ] Listing no longer appears as "ACTIVE" in marketplace

## Transaction IDs

Both transaction IDs are returned to frontend and stored in database:

1. **Payment Transaction**: `buyer ‚Üí seller HBAR transfer` (HashPack wallet signature)
2. **NFT Transfer**: `seller ‚Üí buyer NFT transfer` (Operator key signature)

Both can be viewed on HashScan:
- https://hashscan.io/testnet/transaction/{transactionId}

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Scenario 1: Payment Succeeds, NFT Transfer Fails
- **Risk**: Buyer loses HBAR but doesn't receive NFT
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Payment verified before NFT transfer
  - Comprehensive error logging
  - Payment transaction ID stored for manual refund
- **Action**: Manual intervention required (contact support)

### Scenario 2: Mirror Node Verification Fails
- **Behavior**: No NFT transfer occurs
- **Result**: Buyer keeps HBAR, no database changes
- **Safe**: Transaction reverts gracefully

### Scenario 3: Allowance Not Granted
- **Frontend**: Purchase validation fails
- **Backend**: NFT transfer would fail
- **Recommendation**: Hide "Buy Now" button if allowance not granted

### Scenario 4: Operator Key Invalid
- **Symptom**: NFT transfer fails with authentication error
- **Solution**: Verify OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY in .env is correct
- **Check**: Operator account has sufficient HBAR for fees

## Monitoring & Logs

### Frontend Console Logs:
```
üîê Validating purchase...
‚úÖ Purchase validated

## Why 2-Step Approach?

### ‚ùå Atomic Transaction Failed:
- Buyer can't use operator's allowance
- SPENDER_DOES_NOT_HAVE_ALLOWANCE error

### ‚ùå Escrow Approach Too Complex:
- Requires operator account with balance
- Need refund mechanism infrastructure
- Invalid operator account (0.0.5187830 doesn't exist)

### ‚úÖ 2-Step OpenSea Approach Works:
- Simple buyer ‚Üí seller payment
- Backend uses operator's allowance to transfer NFT
- Proven pattern (used by OpenSea, Rarible, etc.)
- Acceptable risk trade-off

## Next Steps

1. **Restart server** and test with real listing
2. **Verify seller allowance** granted to operator 0.0.6854036
3. **Monitor console logs** during test purchase
4. **Check both transactions** on HashScan
5. **Verify database** updates correctly
6. **Add allowance check** to hide Buy Now for listings without allowance (optional enhancement)

## Support

If purchase fails:
1. Check console logs for specific error
2. Verify payment transaction on HashScan
3. Check operator account balance (needs HBAR for fees)
4. Verify seller granted allowance to operator
5. Check database: listing.allowanceGranted should be true
