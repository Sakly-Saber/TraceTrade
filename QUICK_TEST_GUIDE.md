## 🎨 Modal Colors:
- **Purple** = Grant allowance (list/auction)
- **Orange** = Revoke allowance (remove/cancel)
- **Blue** = Purchase (atomic swap)
- **Green** = Auction bid (already working)

---

## 🔧 What Changed:

### `lib/hashconnect.ts`:
```typescript
// Added this after init:
(window as any).hashconnect = hashconnectInstance
```

### All Modals:
```typescript
// Now use proper init:
const { initHashConnect, getHashConnectInstance, executeTransaction } = await import('@/lib/hashconnect')
await initHashConnect()
const hashconnect = getHashConnectInstance()
// ... execute transaction
```

## 📁 New Files:
1. `components/purchase-modal.tsx` - Atomic swap for purchases
2. `app/api/marketplace/complete-purchase/route.ts` - Update DB after purchase
3. `FIXES_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md` - Full documentation
4. `QUICK_TEST_GUIDE.md` - This file

---

## 🐛 If Issues:
1. **Refresh page** - HashConnect needs clean init
2. **Reconnect wallet** - Click wallet icon in navbar
3. **Check console** - Look for "✅ HashConnect ready"
4. **Check HashPack** - Must be on testnet

---

## ✅ Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Modals open instantly
- ✅ HashPack opens when you click action button
- ✅ No "wallet not connected" errors
- ✅ Smooth animations
- ✅ Clear success/error messages
- ✅ Transactions visible in HashScan

---

## 🎯 Test Order:
1. List NFT (tests allowance grant)
2. Remove listing (tests allowance revoke)
3. List NFT again
4. Use DIFFERENT wallet to buy it (tests atomic swap)
5. Check both wallets - seller has HBAR, buyer has NFT ✅

**Status**: Ready to test! 🚀
**All modals**: Using minting page pattern
**Wallet connection**: Fixed and reliable
